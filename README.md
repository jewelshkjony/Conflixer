## Quick start
Now, that you've installed Conflixer, let's try this tool.

1. Open the terminal and write `Conflixer`.
It'll ask you for two prompts.
    - `Enter aix to keep`: Set the path of the aix or drag the aix file here. The tool will parse this aix as reference.
    - `Enter aix to target`: Set the path of the aix or drag the aix file here. The tool will target the aix to generate new resolved aix.
2. Now the tool will build a new resolved aix within a very few seconds.
3. That's it. Now use the new resolved aix together with the referenced aix.
